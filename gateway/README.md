# Installation

**Step 1.** Copy the `.env.prod` file to the `.env` file and edit it according to your needs.

```
# List all your domains for which you want to issue SSL certificates
LETSENCRYPT_DOMAINS=example.com,www.example.com,api.example.com

# Specify your email
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=example@mail.com
```

**Step 2.** Update templates for desired hosts.

Go to the `reverse-proxy/prod/sites-enabled` directory and replace `example.com` with your domain (without `www`) for each occurrence.

**Step 3.** Create gateway network.

It will be used in all proxy services.

```bash
docker network create gateway
```

**Step 4.** Build containers.

```bash
make build
```

**Step 5.** Issue certificate.

To verify that everything is set up correctly before generating the actual certificate, run the command:

```bash
make ssl.cert.test
```

Then, if you see the message "The dry run was successful.", issue the actual certificate using the command:

```
make ssl.cert
```

**Step 6.** Generate `dhparam` file.

```bash
make ssl.dh
```

**Step 7.** Start containers.

```bash
make up
```
